## Overview

**Q-SPE (Quantum Superposition Entanglement)** is a novel model architecture inspired by the principles of **quantum mechanics**, specifically **superposition** and **entanglement**.  

The architecture introduces the idea of representing computational states not as fixed binary values, but as **probabilistic distributions over multiple simultaneous possibilities**. Unlike classical deep learning layers that deterministically transform vectors, Q-SPE layers encode information in a **superpositional state space**.  

The motivation behind Q-SPE is to explore how quantum-theoretic phenomena can be **simulated or approximated** on classical hardware, while laying theoretical groundwork for deployment on true **quantum computers** in the future.

## Background

- **Superposition**: A system can exist in multiple states at once until observed.  
- **Entanglement**: Two or more systems exhibit correlated behavior, such that observing one instantaneously affects the other, regardless of distance.  
- **Collapse**: Measurement forces a system to resolve into a single definite state.  

Q-SPE draws upon these ideas to create a **mathematical and computational framework** for model training. The system’s *intermediate layers* exist in multi-state forms, with probabilities determining their eventual output upon collapse.

## Mathematical Formulation

Let the state vector of an input feature space be:

\[
\psi(x) = \sum_i \alpha_i |x_i\rangle
\]

where:
- \( |x_i\rangle \) are basis states of features,
- \( \alpha_i \in \mathbb{C} \) are complex coefficients,
- \( \sum_i |\alpha_i|^2 = 1 \).

### Q-SPE Layer Transformation

Each Q-SPE layer applies a **unitary transformation**:

\[
\psi'(x) = U \psi(x)
\]

where \( U \) is a unitary operator satisfying:

\[
U^\dagger U = I
\]

This ensures preservation of total probability amplitude.

### Entanglement Between Layers

For two states \(\psi_A\) and \(\psi_B\), the entangled joint state is expressed as:

\[
\Psi_{AB} = \sum_{i,j} \alpha_{ij} |x_i\rangle_A \otimes |x_j\rangle_B
\]

The measurement of subsystem A influences subsystem B through the shared amplitudes \(\alpha_{ij}\).

### Collapse to Classical Output

The final observable output vector is obtained by probabilistic collapse:

\[
y = \text{argmax}_i \; P(x_i) \quad \text{where } P(x_i) = |\alpha_i|^2
\]

Thus, Q-SPE does not deterministically predict a single outcome, but instead encodes multiple states until observation.

## Implementation Guide

### 1. Environment Setup
Clone this repository and install required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ahmadjamil888/Q-SPE.git
cd Q-SPE
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Running the Demo
The demo simulates superposition states on a classical machine:

```bash
Copy
Edit
python demo.py
The code generates probabilistic outputs reflecting the multi-state superposition and demonstrates entanglement effects between different input features.
```
3. Training
While the current implementation is not fully quantum, training proceeds as follows:

Inputs are encoded as state vectors.

Each Q-SPE layer applies unitary-like transformations.

A measurement operation collapses states to observable values.

Due to classical hardware limits, the simulation complexity grows exponentially with the number of qubits (states).

Example Output

Initial state: |ψ⟩ = [1, 0]
After superposition: |ψ'⟩ = [0.707, 0.707]
Measurement probabilities: [0.50, 0.50]
Observed output: [1, 0] or [0, 1] (probabilistic)

This demonstrates state indeterminacy until collapse.

Strengths
Provides a new perspective on hybrid quantum-classical model design.
